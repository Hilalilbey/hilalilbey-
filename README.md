Step 1 - START
Step 2 - Declare three integer values namely i, j and my_input
Step 3 - Read the required values from the user/ define the values
Step 4 - We iterate through two nested 'for' loops to get space between the characters.
Step 5 - After iterating through the innermost loop, we iterate through another 'for' loop. This will help print the required character.
Step 6 - Now, print a newline to get the specific number of characters in the subsequent lines.
Step 7 - Display the result
Step 8 - Stop
